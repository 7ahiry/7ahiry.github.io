This post is not meant to be a real tutorial. I will just put here the git
command I am used to use and try more or less to explain them. If you need
a complete tutorial, you can find a lot of them by using your favorite internet
research website.

I have become a huge fanatic of git. Now, everytime I enter a directory, the
first question I am asking is: Am I going to produce some text ? If the answer
is yes, then the first command I run in this directory is:

```
git init
```
