Again, this is just a quick post to explain how I manage writing article for
this blog and any other text I am producing especially scientific ones.

The tools I am using for producing text are : vim, git, latex (if needed).

All the texts I am producing are in single files (most of the time) I sometimes
need to split them into different files but this does not change the workflow.

I always use git branch. If I am going to write the introduction, I create
a branch introduction. This forces me to focus on the introduction when I an in
this branch and obviously keep track of commit I have made to produce the
introduction.

When I a done with a section, I merge the branch with master and delete the
branch. This is a classic development workflow (at least this is my idea of
a development workflow).

If I have separate files. For example for the introduction, I still branch to
edit specifically this file. This really helps me to write and re-write things.

So when I am producing a text, I start with a readme (this helps me remember
what was going on in my mind). I never work on the master branch. I try to put
one sentence per line and have short sentences. (It's not thee  case here :-)
but at least I am using a 80 charactere line break).

That's it.
